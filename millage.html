    <h1>Minimum Tillage</h1>
    <div class="about-sub">
      <div class="sub-sub-about">
    
       <p>A minimum tillage system is a method of farming that aims to minimise soil disturbance and tillage while still achieving optimal crop yields. Specialized equipment creates small strips or pockets in the soil, leaving most of the soil undisturbed to achieve this. The techniqueâ€™s goal is to keep plant residue on soil surfaces, preserving moisture, preventing erosion, and improving soil health.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Shallow tillage involves techniques such as reduced furrowing, the application of organic fertilizers, the use of biological means for pest control, and a restrained dependence on chemicals. The method involves the avoidance of primary tillage, relying instead on limited secondary tillage.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Primary tillage breaks up and loosens soil before planting, using heavy equipment for deep tillage. Excessive primary tillage harms soil and the environment by causing compaction, erosion, and loss of organic matter.</li>
        <li>Farmers typically perform secondary tillage at a shallower depth than primary tillage. During secondary tillage, they use implements such as harrows to break up and refine the soil, remove any remaining debris or weeds, and create an appropriate seedbed for planting. Secondary tillage enhances soil structure and fertility, creating a finer surface for improved seed-to-soil contact and crop growth.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of minimum  millage System </h2>
      <div class="about-sub">
        <div class="sub-sub-about">
         <h4>Reduced Soil Erosion</h4>
         <p>Light tillage practices involve leaving crop residues on the soil surface, which helps to reduce soil erosion. It reduces soil erosion by rainfall or wind, preserving soil structure and nutrients.</p>
         <h4>Increased Soil Organic Matter</h4>
         <p>Conservation tillage improves soil quality, increases organic matter and filtration, and reduces erosion, benefiting long-term field and crop investments. Use conservation techniques such as vertical tillage to improve the health of your soil.</p>
         <h4>Improved Soil Structure</h4>
         <p>Minimum tillage systems can help to improve soil structure by reducing soil compaction. Over-tilling soil can cause compaction, reducing water infiltration and root growth.</p>
         <h4>Increased Soil Biodiversity</h4>
         <p>Conservation tillage practices can enhance soil biodiversity by fostering a heterogeneous environment for soil organisms. Retaining crop residues on soil surfaces supports soil organisms, promoting a diverse ecosystem.</p>
         <h4> Increase in Organic Matter</h4>
         <p>When left on the soil surface, plant remains form a protective layer that reduces evaporation and helps retain soil moisture.</p>

      <h2>Why Farmers Should Adopt Zero Tillage System</h2>
    <div class="about-sub">
     
        <div class="sub-sub-about">
          <p>Farmers should adopt zero-tillage systems because they are sustainable farming practices that offer numerous benefits</p><br>
        <p>In Kenya, where agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy, adopting zero-tillage systems can help to improve productivity, conserve natural resources, and promote sustainable agriculture.</p><br>

        <p> By reducing soil erosion and improving soil health, farmers can increase crop yields and improve their livelihoods.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <div class="about-sub">
     
        <div class="sub-sub-about">
          <p>The main goal of minimum tillage is to preserve soil structure and minimize disturbance during crop management.</p><br>

          <p> Retaining crop residues on the soil surface achieves maintaining vital organic matter and promoting healthy soil and crop growth. Minimum tillage can reduce chemical fertilizers and pesticides usage by using crop residues as natural mulch to prevent weed growth.</p><br>
            
          <p>To summarize, minimum tillage is an eco-friendly farming method that can improve soil health, cut costs, and increase crop yields. The adoption of minimum tillage can ultimately lead to a more efficient and environmentally sustainable farming approach. You can rely on the Kelly Tillage System to satisfy your minimum tillage requirements. </p>
